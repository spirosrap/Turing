Turing
======

Universal Turing machine simulator in python.As I was reading carefully Turing's seminal paper I created a simulator for a Turing machine based on the exact description of Turing's paper. Most simulators don't follow the exact same instructions Turing gave but a simplified version of it.

To run the simulation enter "python turingn.py"
